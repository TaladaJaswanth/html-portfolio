   <hr />    
   <h3>Alita: The Battle Angel</h3>
   <p>this is a great movie talks about a warrior robot post apoclypse and how she gets through the world and actually fights the supreme to save the world. these are kinds of movies that brings back you the memories.</p>
   <h3>Ready player one</h3>
   <p>this is a trans world where people are hyper productive and where they live in different universes that meta envisions.</p>
   <h3>Bahubali 2</h3>
   <p>this is one of the first movies as a kid i watched,which i am highly facinated by the quality of the picture and the way the film takes you into a flow state with feeling of winning throughout and a bid of sad emotion but insecure we are losing emotion.</p>
